# Mathematical Modeling in Python

The codes here are implements of the book "The Algorithm and Application of Mathematical Modeling". (The original codes are implemented by Matlab in the book.)

**Codes here are just my exercise and notes when reading this book. Many faults are left.**

**Some codes are copied from others' blogs, the sources has been noted!**
